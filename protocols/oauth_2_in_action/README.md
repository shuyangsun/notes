# OAuth 2 in Action by [Justin Richer](https://www.manning.com/authors/justin-richer) and [Antonio Sanso](https://www.manning.com/authors/antonio-sanso)

OAuth 2.0 is a delegation protocol, it allows a software application to access certain resources on behalf of the resource owner without having to impersinating them.

Even though authentication methods can be built on top of the OAuth protocol, the protocol itself is not authentication protocol (are you who you say you are?), an authorization protocol (access to resource).
