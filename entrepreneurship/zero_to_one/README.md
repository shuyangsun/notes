# Zero to One by [Peter Thiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterthiel/)

## 5. Last Mover Advantage

TODO

## 6. You are not a Lottery Ticket

This chapter is interesting. It has the opposite opinion of other the-black-swan-ish books and views, but funny that both camps say something along the line of "I believe so but I have no way to prove it, and it is impossible to prove one way or the other". The chapter argued that the recent popularity of luck-driven success is making people underate the importance of planning.

An interesting categorization in this chapter is by the four quadrants of definite/indefinite and optimistic/pessimistic.

high <--------------- Investment ---------------> low

|             | Definite          | Indefinite         | (Savings) |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Optimistic  | U.S., 1950s-1960s | U.S., 1982-present | low       |
| Pessimistic | China, present    | Europe, present    | high      |

"While a definitely optimistic future would need engineers to design underwater cities and settlements in space, an indefinitely optimistic future calls for more bankers and lawyers."

## 7. Follow the Money

This chapter is mostly about the phenomenon that startups follow the power law. In other words, startups live in the world of "extremesm" and not "mediocresm" ([The Black Swan](../../psychology/the_black_swan/README.md)).

"Once you think that you're playing the lottery, you've already psychologically prepared yourself to lose."

"Some moments matter far more than others."

## 8. Secrets

There are plenty of secrets (opportunities) to be discovered. The chapter has some interesting takes on why most people nowadays act like there are no more secrets left to be discovered (e.g., globalization and "other smarter people would've done it already"). *DON'T THINK LIKE THAT!*

Once you find a secret, only tell the people who need to know, and no more.

**"A great company is a conspiracy to change the world."**

I do find the HP example in this chapter is quite narrative-ish and a classic example of hindsight study of history. It closed with HP's stock price at 2012 as an indicator of success, but that's right after the 2008 crash (the crash was even used as an examples just pages prior).

## 9. Foundations

This chapter emphasizes the importance of foundation, which *should* be obvious. One of the important ideas are the separation of ownership, possession and control (possession is a confusing word choice here IMO, it sounds too similar to ownership, it's more like "operation").

* Ownership: who legally owns a company's equity? (founders, early employees and investors)
* Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis? (managers and employees)
* Control: who formally governs the company's affairs? (board of directors, usually founders and investors)

It is important to align the direction across different roles. A couple good quotes from this chapter:

"A board of three is ideal. Your board should never exceed five people."

"A company does the better the less it pays the CEO. ... If a CEO collects more than $300,000 per year, \[they\] risk becoming more like a politician than a founder."

"Any kind of cash is more about the present than the future."

## 10. The Mechanics of Mafia

"No company has a culture, every company *is* a culture."

I like the message in this chapter about it is extremely important to hiring the right people and pick the right partners, and recruiting is a company's core competency.

What I didn't like is I got a sense from this chapter to only hire people who "drink the Kool-Aid" and think alike. It is important to share the same mission and be passionate about it, but having most people thinking alike on a team is very dangerous.

It's fine to not question the mission or end goal too much, but it is encouraged and necessary to question the approach. It sounds easy, but too many times people confuse their approach as their goal.

## 11. If You Build It, Will They Come?

This chapter described someone exactly like me: "advertising matters because it works. It works on *nerds*, and it works on *you*". I have always been the nerd described in this chapter: having a distaste about sales because it's all about putting on a show, whereas engineering provides irreplaceable value, they are almost the opposite of each other. I've also believed that good products sell themselves, no sales should be required for good products. The phrase "nerds who instinctively mistrust the media often make the mistake of trying to ignore it".

Unfortunately, that is simply not true. *It takes hard work to make sales look easy.* The grandmaster salesmen do not appear as salesmen.

Next time if I try to ignore sales, ask myself the question: "how many great products you could actually benefit from you missed out on?" The answer is probably "too many", because the companies built great products but didn't have good distribution never made it to your ear before they went bankrupt.
